This is the alpha version of IntruSpotter. This software is slightly more complex to master than the others but nothing insurmountable...
<br><br>When you run the program, the files "danger_ico.ico", "oui.txt" and "protocol.txt" must be in the same directory as the program. These files are necessary for the software to work properly.
<br><br>It is possible to import a list of safe IP addresses and a list of black IP addresses into the software. The "ip_list_template.txt" file is intended to give you a model for the syntax to adopt.
