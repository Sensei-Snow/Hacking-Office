<h3>Here you'll find some very simple pentesting software, all written in Python and very well commented. This project aims to be a hacking office suite for beginners.</h3>
<br>

- <h4>The first program is SSH-Devastator.</h4>
It's an easy-to-use SSH bruteforce program.
<br>It requires the following libraries: pyfiglet - paramiko - socket - time.
<br>If you wish to run the code from the SSH server in question, use the loopback IP address: 127.0.0.1.

- <h4>The second program is SnoopPort.</h4>
It's an easy-to-use ports scanner program.
<br>It requires the following libraries: pyfiglet - socket - time.
<br>If you wish to run the code from the computer in question, use the loopback IP address: 127.0.0.1.

- <h4>The third program is IntruSpotter.</h4>
It's an easy-to-use program to scan an entire network and find the intrus and more...
<br>It requires the following libraries: pyfiglet - plyer - scapy - time.
<br>It also needs a few documents (.txt) which are in the directory.
<br>it is an alpha version, all the features are not available but you can have a brief overview of this future tool.

- <h4>My projects for the future :</h4>
1) Release the V1.0 of IntruSpotter.
2) Release the graphic version of SnoopPort with QBit.
3) Release a C++ version of SSH-Devastator which will be faster as the python version but more complex.

<br><h5>Thanks to TechieNeurons who helped me for SSH-Devastator and SnoopPort.</h5>
