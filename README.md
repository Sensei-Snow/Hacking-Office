<h3>Here you'll find some very simple pentesting software, all written in Python and very well commented. This project aims to be a hacking office suite for beginners.</h3>
<br>

- <h4>The first program is SSH-Devastator.</h4>
It's an easy-to-use SSH bruteforce program.
<br>It requires the following libraries: pyfiglet - paramiko - socket - time.
